 Contributions are welcome. Contact me at raghunandan2005@gmail.com

# Todo

1. Check for network connectivity.
2. Improve ui.
3. Initial launch of the app default theme is applied and once onCreate of application class finishes then user choosen theme is applied.
This is related to cold launch time. Subsequent app launches are fine. This needs to be fixed.
